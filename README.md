# uOS
web desktop focused on productivity (WIP)

- keyboard first, like Emacs|Vim but better
- minimal UI, distraction-free
- text productivity, but not plain
- programmer friendly

# demo
- https://uos.now.sh/

# short-term goal
- make a cross-platform working environment
- so that I can just use a tablet+keyboard, instead of a whole laptop|PC

# development
- uOS is already using online IDE (CodeSandbox)
- just visit [https://codesandbox.io/s/github/zeo1/uOS](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/zeo1/uOS)
- and then start development
- no more `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm start`

# roadmap

- [ ] note|markdown editor
